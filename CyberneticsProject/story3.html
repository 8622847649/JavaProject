IEEE 802.16 standard was designed to support the bandwidth demanding applications with quality of  service (QoS). Bandwidth is reserved for each application to ensure the QoS.For variable bit rate (VBR) applications, however, it is difficult for the subscriber stations (SSs) to predict the amount of incoming data. To ensure the QoS guaranteed services, the SS may reserve bandwidth more than the amount of its transmitting dataAs a result, the reserved bandwidth may not be fully utilized all the time.we propose a scheme, named Bandwidth Recycling, to recycle the unused bandwidth without changing the existing bandwidth reservation.The idea of our scheme is to allow other SSs to utilize the unused bandwidth when it is availableThus, not only the same QoS guaranteed services can be provided but also the system throughput can be improved.</i></b></p><BR><BR>
